#CSS Portfolio Assignment

This assignment proved to be a challenge, and after spending the week on it doing as much as I can, I've ended at an impasse and have decided to opt for a re-submission at a future date. 

I was able to create some basic layout elements, but some parts did not behave as expected. I have listed these roadblocks in the issues tab on this Repo to detail some of the issues I ran into. 

The main reason I've decided to try this project again at a later date is to keep up with the current content learning Javascript, I know it is incredibily difficult by comparison and I think I will be able to revisit this assignment with ease in the future if I keep up with the current course work. 

I also had a tutoring session to work on this assignment, and although the session was helpful, my tutor ended up writing a lot of code for me and re-writing a lot of my old code. He was able to fix some issues that I couldn't solve on my own, but the new code did bring back some issues I had already solved, and I have found it difficult to approach the rest of this assignment going off of another person's code. As such, the most recent commit that reflects code I wrote is my 2nd commit from June 7th. I don't know how to revert my code back to that commit but I imagine it can be done.

All this being said, I know I'm missing a lot of bits on the project criteria, namely Media query functionality and alignment issues in the main section. I'm sure I will have the tools to revisit this later and meet the project criteria, but in the meantime I've got a lot of javascript to learn.
